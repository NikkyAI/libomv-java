The basic library is not yet fully ported. Look for TO BE PORTED in comments.

Most examples are ported, but none of the more complex applications in the libomv suite.

What is working at this point but more testing is required:

- GridList selection
- XML_RPC login
- LLLP (LindenLab Legacy Protocol) UDP protocol handling

Implemented but needs lots of testing:
- HTTP CAPS protocol handling
- Buddylist handling
- Inventory handling
- Chat and IM handling
- Basic Avatar names
- Basic Group management
- Basic Asset management
- Basic Parcel management

What needs to be attacked:
- JPEG2000 implementation
- Appearence management

- OpenGL render interface
- Prim, Sculpt, Mesh renderer
- Character (Avatar) renderer

For 3D implementation we should probably look at what ogoglio could offer in that respect.
It's Apache license seems compatible enough to use in this project.
